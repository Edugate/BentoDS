# BentoDS
BentoDS is a simple IdP Discovery Service (SAML).
## Features
* support source data generated by [Jagger](https://github.com/Edugate/Jagger)

## Installation

### Requirements
   * nodejs
   * compass (can be installed with gem)
   
     ```bash
     gem install compass
     ```
     
   * recomended to install grunt, grunt-cli, bower globally
     ```bash
     npm install -g grunt grunt-cli bower
     ```
     
### Configuration
   * copy config-tmp.json to ngDS.json
   * modify ngDS.json
     * title : title header
     * logo : filename with you logo - copy you logo into app/img/
     * basehref : URI of your service - for example if you plan to set you DiscoveryService as https://example.com/WAYF/ 
       you need to set '/WAYF/' - remember about slashes
     * srcidplist : URL of you Jagger instance's controller 
     * srcdataapp : keep it as it is - 'jagger'
     * srcidplistfallback : optional location of data - needs to be the same format as generated from srcidplist
     * srcdataappfallback : keep as it is 'jagger'
     * srcrequesterinfo : url to retrieve info about SP from jagger
     * xdomainproxyurl : to get IE9 working properly you need to create proxy.html file somewhere on virtualhost where you want
       to retrieve data from. The proxy.html should look like:

       ```html
       <!DOCTYPE HTML>
       <script src="xdomain.min.js" master="*"></script>
       ```
       xdomain js can be pulled from https://github.com/jpillora/xdomain
       
### Building
  go to you application directory
  ```bash
  $ npm install
  $ bower install
  $ grunt build
  ```
  it will generate final files into **dist** directory

  Then you need to configure you apache to point to this Directory
  
## ToDo
 * tests scripts
 * add suport to Shibboleth DiscoFeed
